Fork from chaz branch of FPDB project (Please visit http://fpdb.sourceforge.net for documentation, tips and help.)

I added the following features for my own use:

- auto detect for winamax installation
- fix a bug with free winamax tournament on French version
- plot contains 2 colors: green when profit, red when loss
- autoplot the graphs when going in a new tab
- you can filter columns to show/hide (in Tourney Stats for example) and filter them
- added a "bankroll" view, to manage it efficiently!
